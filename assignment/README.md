## Week-8-Assignmnet

**_Deadline Wednesday evening_**


The tasks are all about Javascript and jQuery exercise. It is going to be very beneficial for you. Try to gain the most from it..

### Description

1. First of all fork [jQuery-Assignment](https://github.com/livecodingonline/jQuery-Assignment) repository. After forking you should see the repo in your own GitHub account. 

2. Now you have the repo in your GitHub. Clone the repo. Now you can work locally.

3. The project contains `index.html`,  `style.css` and `app.js`. The css and js files are already connected to the html file. So you may start writing js code right away. If you preview the html, you will see no functioning web-page. Your task is to make them functioning.

#### Here are the tasks to do

- `Delete` buttons should remove the topics (`li` elements). 
- `Add` button should add a topic (an `li` element inside 2 `span` elements).
- There is a `checkbox` under the topics. It should hide all topics when checked, unhide when unchecked. (hide all `ul` elements)
- There is search field above. It should filter the topics (filter `li` elements). It should be case-insensitive.

If you have a problem in forking cloning and starting the issue locally; please ask for an help immediately. These are not the tasks for this week, use your energies wisely. For the other bullet points; push yourself and try to solve them on your own but again you shouldn't be working in one bullet point more than 3 hours, please ask for an help when you stuck.
